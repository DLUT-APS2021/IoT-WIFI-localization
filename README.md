this repository is simulation practices based on Manikanta Kotaru's two paper: 1."SpotFi: Decimeter Level Localization Using WiFi", SIGCOMM. London,United Kingdom, 2015 2."Position Tracking for Virtual RealityUsing CommodityWiFi," IEEE. Trans. Stanford University. US, CVPR,2017 by using simulation data and experimental data.

While the Wicapture's simulation is based on spotFi's simulation, by using its MUSIC and smoothingCSI algorithms.
